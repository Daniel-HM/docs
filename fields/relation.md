# Relation

A relation picker. Relation pickers can be created for any relation of your
model.

![relation picker](./screens/relation/picker.jpg 'relation picker')

The relation field requires the name of the relation that should be edited. The
type of the relation is automatically recognized and displayed accordingly.

The relations Field can only be used for **Crud Models** and not in **Forms** or
**Blocks**. For Forms or Blocks the [oneRelation](#onerelation-and-manyrelation)
or [manyRelation](#onerelation-and-manyrelation) field can be used.

```php
$form->relation('articles')
    ->title('Articles')
     ->preview(function ($table) {
        // Build the preview table in here.
        $table->col('title'); // In this case we are showing the article title.
    });;
```

In the Model:

```php
public function articles()
{
    return $this->hasMany('App/Models/Article');
}
```

## Preview

The table preview is configured in preview.

```php
$form->relation('articles')
    ->title('Articles')
    ->preview(function ($table) {
        // Build the preview table in here.
        $table->col('title'); // In this case we are showing the article title.
    });
```

However you don't need to define a new preview table every time you create a new
relation field. You can simply display the index table of the related Model by
setting settings its Crud config class in the `use` method list this:

```php
use Lit\Config\Crud\ArticleConfig;

$form->relation('articles')
    ->title('Articles')
    ->use(ArticleConfig::class);
```

## Sortable

If the relation should be sortable, the related query in your Model must be
sorted by an `orderColumn`.

```php
public function articles()
{
    return $this->hasMany('App/Models/Article')->orderBy('order_column');
}
```

Now the sortable attribute can be added:

```php
$form->relation('articles')
    ->title('Articles')
    ->sortable()
    ->preview(function ($table) {
        $table->col('Title')->value('{title}');
    });
```

## Filter

With a **filter** you can specify which models can be selected for a relation.

```php
$form->relation('articles')
    ->title('Articles')
    ->filter(function($query) {
        $query->where('created_by', lit_user()->id);
    });
```

## Eager Loading & Appending Accessors

With query, **relationships** & **accessors** that should be displayed can be
**eager loaded** or **appended**.

```php
$form->relation('articles')
    ->title('Articles')
    ->query(function($query) {
        $query->with('author')->append('comments_count');
    })
    ->preview(function ($table) {
        $table->col('Author')->value('{author.first_name} {author.last_name}');
        $table->col('Comments')->value('{comments_count} comments');
    });
```

## Allow Direct Delete

To switch off the modal in which deleting a relation is confirmed, `confirm`
must be set to false.

```php
$form->relation('articles')
    ->title('Articles')
    ->confirm(false);
```

## Tags

For **many relations** a `tag` preview can be generated by passing `tags` to the
`type` method. Therefore the **attribute** that should be displayed in the tag
must be specified using `tagValue`. Furthermore the variant can be specified
with `tagVariant`.

```php
$form->relation('tags')
    ->title('Tags')
    ->type('tags')
    ->tagValue('{value}');
```

## oneRelation And manyRelation

Every Laravel relation needs its corresponding database setup. For example the
belongsTo relation needs an extra column that stores the id of the related
Model. However you migth want to create relations without going through the
process of creating a new migration to add the required columns/tables. For this
there is the `oneRelation` and `manyRelation`. They can simply be added to your
Models or Forms.

The following example shows the simplep setup of a the relation field that works
for both:

```php
use App\Models\Article;

$form->manyRelation('articles')
    ->title('Articles')
    ->model(Article::class)
    ->preview(function($preview) {
        //...
    });
```

In the Model:

```php
public function articles()
{
    return $this->manyRelation('App/Models/Article', 'articles');
}
```

:::tip

`oneRelation` and `manyRelation` can be used in Forms.
