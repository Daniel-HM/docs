# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading from 2.4 to 3.x

Due to a trademark dispute the name used in version 2.4 for the packet had to be
changed. Considering the fact that this will cause big breaking changes, we have
decided to make significant changes in the architecture. Unfortunately this also
means that we cannot provide an upgrade guide. But you are free to develop your
own solution and if possible make it available to the community.
