# Installation

## Requirements

Hello World!

An existing Laravel project is required to install the package as well as a
database connection. The package requires **PHP 7.4+** and **Laravel 7+**. As
well as all
[requirements](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-medialibrary/v8/requirements) of
**spatie/laravel-medialibrary 8.2+**.

## Setup

Installing the package into an existing Laravel application via Composer:

```shell
composer require litstack/litstack
```

The application will automatically register the needed service providers. The
next step is to process all publishes and migrations by typing the following
artisan command:

```shell
php artisan lit:install
```

Now all models have been moved to the `app/models` folder, all required files
have been published and all migrations have been executed.

The admin interface can be reached via the standard route `/admin`. The route
may be changed in the config file `lit.php` by changing the `route_prefix` key.

The final step is to create an admin user so you can log in to the backend:

```shell
php artisan lit:admin
```

The wizard will guide you through the process of entering the required user
data.
